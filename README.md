### Project Documentation Interactive Dictionary

#### Overview
The Interactive Dictionary project aims to create a Python program that allows users to look up definitions of words interactively. The program utilizes web scraping techniques to fetch word definitions from the Merriam-Webster dictionary website. Users can input a word, and the program will retrieve and display its definition.

#### Features
1. Word Lookup Users can input a word and retrieve its definition.
2. Interactive Interface The program provides a user-friendly interface for word lookup.
3. Online Dictionary Integration Definitions are fetched from the Merriam-Webster dictionary website using web scraping.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- requests library
- BeautifulSoup library

#### Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip
    ```
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

#### Usage
1. Run the `dictionary.py` script using Python
    ```
    python dictionary.py
    ```
2. Enter a word when prompted.
3. The program will display the definition of the entered word. Enter quit to exit the program.

#### Code Structure
- `dictionary.py` Contains the main program code.
  - `fetch_definition(word)` Function to fetch the definition of a word from the Merriam-Webster website.
  - `interactive_dictionary()` Function to provide an interactive interface for users to look up words.
- `README.md` Documentation file providing information about the project, usage, and installation instructions.

#### Dependencies
- `requests` Used for sending HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
- `beautifulsoup4` Used for parsing HTML content retrieved from web pages.

#### Example Usage
```
python dictionary.py
Enter a word to look up (or type 'quit' to exit) python
The definition of 'python' is any of various large constricting snakes
Enter a word to look up (or type 'quit' to exit) computer
The definition of 'computer' is one that computes; specifically  a programmable usually electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data
Enter a word to look up (or type 'quit' to exit) quit
Goodbye!
```

### Conclusion
The Interactive Dictionary project demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques to create an interactive dictionary program. By integrating with online resources, users can access a vast database of word definitions conveniently. This project serves as a practical example of Python programming, web scraping, and user interaction.
